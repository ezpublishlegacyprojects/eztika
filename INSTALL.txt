*Installing eZTika


Requirements:
- eZ Publish 4.0.1 or later.
- Java Runtime Environment 5.0 or later. ( http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp )
- Unix like OS, although the Bourne shell script is a good base for creating a windows .bat file


Installing:
1. Extract the eztika extension, and place it in the extensions folder.

2. Copy the eztika shell script and tika.jar from the extension bin folder to a 
   location your web server has access to and edit the shell script
   as well to set the path to the tika.jar file (make sure it is executable) 

3. Enable the extension in eZ Publish. Do this by opening settings/override/site.ini.append.php ,
   and add in the [ExtensionSettings] block:
   ActiveExtensions[]=eztika

4. Update the class autoloads by running the script: php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php

5. Edit extension/eztika/settings/binaryfile.ini.append.php and adapt the PATH to the eztika script:


[MultiHandlerSettings]

#Change the path to the eztika shell script
TextExtractionTool=<path to>/eztika
